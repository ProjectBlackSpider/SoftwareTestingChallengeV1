
Design and Reasoning


1. Given the above high level requirements, what are some of the questions you would ask each of following team members to understand this feature better?

Product owner
-What licence do we have on this product?
-How many users does our licence accomodate?
-Is the Licence enough for all employees who will be using this system and if not enough, how do we upgrade to accomodate new users?
-Do we need all users to have access and what kind of access?
-What do we want to capture as user details?
-What is the primary ID to be used and what will be used for searching a user?
-How will users be removed, what is it that need to be checked for a user to be eligible to be removed?
-what should be editable?
-Who need to have access to remove users and is there a process for such request?
-How will we manage data retention?

UX designer
-How many forms will we have?
-How will the home screen look like and what will be on the home screen?
-Will an Administrator and any normal user have the same user interface?
-How will the interface handle "Error handling and exceptions"?

Technical Architect
-How many tables will we have and how will they be linked
-Will we be able to see inactive users and when last did they login?
-How will we handle backups?
-Will there be Primary and DR for the DB and how will they be replicated?
-How will we know of active and inactive users, let say using a period of 6 months?

2. In order to delight the user with these features, how would you want it to work?

-Have a process about adding users which once a request for a new user to be added is approved, Administrators then add the user
-All required information to be provided and added 
-Once a user is added, to then login to test if they able to login and for every logins, they must be captured on a login/activity table for auditing purposes
-Administrators to have a different view with the users as theirs should have options to add. update and remove users, while users have option to update relevant information, not all information.
-Administrators to have a view of available licences, active users and inactive users so that a follow up can be made to find out if users still need to have access

3. Based on your response to the previous question what would you automate in the testing of this feature?

-Automated Login for an existing user
-Automated search and update after the login have passed, if new value is found on 2nd search after an update was done, then Pass
-Automated Admin delete and search, if no results returned then pass, if results returned then Fail
-Automated login for a non existing user
-Automated Comparison for number of licences to number of active users and they should match in numbers, if no match then an inactive user exists utilising a licence
